# Dessert Clicker App

## Introduction

Welcome to **Dessert Clicker**, an engaging Android application that blends the excitement of a clicker game with hands-on learning about Android development. In this app, you tap a button to create a variety of delicious desserts, earning virtual currency with each press. Beyond the fun, Dessert Clicker is a key part of the **Android Basics with Compose Codelab**, designed to help you explore the Android activity lifecycle and master logging messages to the Android console (Logcat). Get ready to bake, earn, and learn!

## Features

- **Dessert Creation:** Tap the button to produce desserts and boost your earnings.
- **Visual Feedback:** Watch dessert images change as you progress through different levels.
- **Progress Tracking:** Keep tabs on your total desserts made and revenue earned.
- **Lifecycle Exploration:** See real-time logs of Android lifecycle events in Logcat.
- **Modern Tech:** Built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for a reactive, modern UI.

## How to Play

1. Launch the app on an emulator or Android device.
2. Tap the prominent dessert button to create a dessert.
3. Each tap adds to your dessert count and increases your virtual earnings.
4. Observe how the dessert image updates as you hit new milestones.

## Technical Details

Dessert Clicker is crafted using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**, reflecting current best practices in Android development. Here’s what powers the app:

- **Android Activity Lifecycle:** The app logs key lifecycle events—`onCreate()`, `onStart()`, `onResume()`, `onPause()`, `onStop()`, and `onDestroy()`—to illustrate their order and purpose.
- **Logcat Integration:** Uses `Log` statements to send messages to Logcat, offering a window into app behavior and debugging techniques.
- **State Management:** Leverages Jetpack Compose’s state handling to update the UI seamlessly as you interact with the app.

## Pre-requisites

To dive into Dessert Clicker and the codelab, you’ll need:

- Basic skills in opening, building, and running apps in **Android Studio**.
- Knowledge of what an **Android activity** is and how to create one.
- Understanding of the `onCreate()` method, including the operations typically performed there (e.g., initializing UI components).

## Getting Started
